# Transaction Screening and Multi-hop Analysis Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated the latest features from the sanction-detector backend service, including:
- Transaction screening by TXID
- Multi-hop transaction analysis 
- Updated bulk screening with support for both addresses and transactions
- Enhanced UI with tabbed interface for better user experience

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Service (`src/services/api.ts`)
- Added new TypeScript interfaces:
  - `TransactionAddress`: Individual address in transaction screening results
  - `TransactionScreeningResult`: Complete transaction screening response
  - `TransactionScreeningRequest`: Transaction screening request parameters
- Added `screenTransaction` method for single transaction screening
- Updated `bulkScreening` method to support both addresses and transactions
- Enhanced summary calculations to include both address and transaction metrics

### 2. Completely Rebuilt AddressScreening Component (`src/pages/AddressScreening.tsx`)
- **New Tabbed Interface**: 
  - Tab 1: Address Screening (existing functionality)
  - Tab 2: Transaction Screening (new)
  - Tab 3: Bulk Screening (enhanced)

- **Transaction Screening Features**:
  - Transaction hash validation (64 hex characters)
  - Direction selection (inputs, outputs, both)
  - Metadata inclusion option
  - Input/output address breakdown with individual risk scores
  - Sanction match details per address

- **Enhanced Bulk Screening**:
  - Side-by-side input fields for addresses and transactions
  - Separate result tables for addresses and transactions
  - Updated metrics to include both types
  - Validation for both address and transaction formats

- **Improved UI Components**:
  - Better error handling and validation
  - Responsive layout with Material-UI components
  - Expandable sections for detailed results
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
  - Progress indicators and loading states

### 3. Settings and Configuration
- **Multi-hop Analysis**: Toggle to enable/disable transaction analysis
- **Analysis Depth**: Slider to control maximum hops (1-10)
- **Direction Control**: For transaction screening (inputs/outputs/both)
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Option for additional transaction metadata

## API Integration Details

### New Endpoints Supported
1. `POST /api/screening/transaction` - Screen individual transactions
2. `POST /api/screening/bulk` - Enhanced bulk screening with transactions
3. Updated response handling for multi-hop analysis results

### Request/Response Format Updates
- **Transaction Screening Request**:
  ```typescript
  {
    txHash: string,
    direction?: 'inputs' | 'outputs' | 'both',
    includeMetadata?: boolean
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced Bulk Request**:
  ```typescript
  {
    addresses?: string[],      // Up to 100 addresses
    transactions?: string[],   // Up to 50 transactions
    batchId?: string,
    includeTransactionAnalysis?: boolean
  }
  ```

## User Experience Improvements

### Navigation and Organization
- Clean tabbed interface separating different screening types
- Intuitive icons and labels for each screening mode
- Settings panel available across all tabs

### Results Display
- **Address Results**: Traditional risk score, level, and sanction matches
- **Transaction Results**: Overall risk + breakdown by input/output addresses
- **Bulk Results**: Separate accordion sections for addresses and transactions
- **Summary Metrics**: Total processed, high risk count, sanction matches, processing time

### Validation and Error Handling
- Real-time validation for Bitcoin addresses and transaction hashes
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Rate limiting awareness (100 addresses, 50 transactions per batch)
- Comprehensive error boundary with user-friendly messages

## Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Interfaces
All new interfaces are properly typed to match the backend API specifications from the latest API.md documentation.

### Component Architecture
- Functional component with React hooks
- Proper state management with `useState` and `useCallback`
- Efficient re-rendering with memoized callbacks
- Clean separation of concerns

### Material-UI Integration
- Consistent design language with existing components
- Responsive grid layout
- Accessible form controls and navigation
- Professional data tables and metric cards

## Testing and Validation

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Address screening with valid Bitcoin addresses
- ✅ Transaction screening with valid transaction hashes
- ✅ Bulk screening with mixed addresses and transactions
- ✅ Multi-hop analysis toggle functionality
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs
- ✅ Loading states and progress indicators

### Build and Compilation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ No runtime warnings or console errors
- ✅ All imports and dependencies resolved

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Export Functionality**: CSV/JSON export of bulk screening results
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter results by risk level, sanction status
3. **Historical Data**: Store and retrieve previous screening results
4. **Batch Management**: Save and load address/transaction lists
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live screening updates

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Virtualized Tables**: For large bulk screening results
2. **Pagination**: For handling very large result sets
3. **Caching**: Client-side caching of recent screening results
4. **Progressive Loading**: Lazy loading of detailed results

## Summary
The frontend now fully supports the latest sanction-detector backend features, providing a comprehensive OFAC compliance and sanctions screening solution for both Bitcoin addresses and transactions. The interface is intuitive, responsive, and provides detailed insights into multi-hop transaction analysis results.
